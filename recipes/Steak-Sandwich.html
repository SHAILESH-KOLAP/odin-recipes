    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>steak sandwich is packed with flavor</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound thinly sliced sirloin steak strips</li>
      <li>8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
      <li>10 slices provolone cheese</li>
      <li>1 loaf French bread</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can beef broth</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>¼ cup Pinot Noir or other dry red wine</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add steak and cook until
        browned. Add mushrooms, bell pepper, and onion; cook and stir until just
        tender, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a slow cooker, combine beef broth, salt, pepper, Worcestershire
        sauce, red pepper flakes, and red wine. Transfer steak and vegetables to
        the slow cooker; stir to blend. Cover and cook on High for 3 to 4 hours,
        or until beef is extremely tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Drain liquid from the
        slow cooker and save for dipping.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice French bread loaf lengthwise like a submarine sandwich. Mix
        together horseradish and mustard; spread onto the inside of loaf. Place
        slices of provolone cheese on both sides of loaf, then fill with steak
        and vegetables. Close the loaf and wrap with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. For crunchier bread,
        you can bake it without the aluminum foil. Slice into 4 sandwiches;
        serve with the juices from the slow cooker for dipping.
      </li>
    </ol>
